# ✅ Project Fixed & Ready!

## 🚀 What changed?
1. **Database Switched to SQLite**: No Docker or PostgreSQL installation needed anymore! database is built-in.
2. **Frontend Fixed**: Tailwind CSS errors resolved.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Backend
Open terminal in `server` folder:
```powershell
npm run dev
```
*You should see "✅ SQLite database initialized" and "Server running on port 5000"*

### 2. Frontend
Open terminal in `client` folder:
```powershell
# Stop any running server first (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open App
Go to: **http://localhost:5173**
